    "## Transformations and Immutability\n",
    "Transformations in PySpark will transform a Spark DataFrame into a new DataFrame without altering the original data. This means that Spark is **immutable** (i.e there is no `inplace=True` argument like some `pandas` methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, operations will return transformed results rather than mutating the original. Therefore, it is quite common to see:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sdf = sdf.withColumn(\n",
    "    'int_col',\n",
    "    F.col('str_numerical_col').cast('INT')\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lazy Evaluation at the High Level\n",
    "Finally, Spark operations are evaluated lazily. This is because there is a driver under-the-hood which looks to optimize and make your operations more efficient. This means that your data does not \"move\" until called upon. Let's explore how this works at the high-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)\n",
    "For those who have not taken 2nd year algorithms, a DAG is a graph where there are \"no loops\". That is, one can only traverse forward and never backwards. This is especially useful (in this context) with representing a job or processes. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![dag](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmichal.karzynski.pl%2Fimages%2Fillustrations%2F2017-03-19%2Fairflow-example-dag.png&f=1&nofb=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have a DAG generated by Apache Airflow which manages a certain job. From left to right, things are run in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spark, DAGs, and Lazy Evaluation \n",
    "Specifically for Spark, transformations are added to a DAG similar to the above example. Whenever the Spark driver requests data (i.e writing, using `.collect()`, etc), the DAG gets executed. This means that until we need to **physicalize** the data, no code is run at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this good? The major advantage is that Spark makes several code optimizations under-the-hood by looking at the whole DAG each time you add a step. For any in-built transformation or function, Spark will optimize the efficiency by reordering the steps or taking shortcuts to simplify several steps. This is not possible if the data is physicalized each time you run it like `pandas`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- You execute every transformation like `pandas`.\n",
    "- This means you must physicalise every intermediate step into memory. Whilst this can be fast, you are limited by the memory (RAM). \n",
    "- When you take into account the costs of RAM over time (especially if this is an ETL pipeline that you run daily), this is not efficient. This is because you are never really interested in the intermediate transformation steps when running a production pipeline. \n",
    "- As such, your job when writing Spark is to tell Spark the overall process and let it figure it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "General Rules:\n",
    "- Always use built-in functions and methods where possible. This is because Spark is designed to optimize code that it understands.\n",
    "- When applying a custom user function known as a **User Defined Function** (UDF), Spark does not understand the function code. This means it is is black box and will eat up resources and time.\n",
    "- Never use `.collect()` if possible, aim to plan your code out and only physicalize your data when required. \n",
    "- Save \"checkpoints\" for your dataset. If you have applied a few transformations and are happy with this intermediate step, save it. That way, you don't need to keep rerunning your code every time you need the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lazy Evaluation in applications\n",
    "Lazy evaluation is also extensively used in many other applications. Python natively have generator/yield as a way to implement lazy evaluation. TensorFlow, a popular tensor computing library also implements lazy evaluation via [computation graphs](https://d3lm.medium.com/understand-tensorflow-by-mimicking-its-api-from-scratch-faa55787170d) (DAG).\n",

    "3. The scale and axis need to make sense (and you can assume the reader knows the difference between a normal scale vs log scale).\n",

    "    - Scatterplot vs Histogram plot to see distribution\n",
